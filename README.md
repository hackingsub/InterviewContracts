## Request

Halborn requests you to audit these smart contracts. Not only look at the code risks but also the economic aspects.

We realized developers were lazy and they forgot including some files in the repository. In addition, we want to make sure that we can compile and deploy the contracts to the testnet, it could be useful if you deploy the contracts locally. 

Finally, during the meetings with them they used to make some jokes about rug-pulls and they will deploy the contracts to the mainnet themselves.
